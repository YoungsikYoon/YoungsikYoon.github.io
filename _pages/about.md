Hello! I'm Youngsik Yoon, a Ph.D. candidate in the POSTECH Machine Learning Lab, where I am supervised by Professor Jungseul Ok.
I received my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering & Mathematics from POSTECH.
Previously, I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), where I was fortunate to be mentored by Wei Chen and Siwei Wang. 
Our project focused on efficient exploration strategies in combinatorial settings where the reward structure evolves with exploration.

My research goal is to build efficient and reliable machine learning models that can learn and reason in complex environments.
My primary interests are (i) efficient exploration strategies in RL and (ii) developing agentic LLMs for complex reasoning tasks like coding and mathematics.

For more details, please see my CV. you can reach me at ysyoon97@postech.ac.kr.
